# Guidelines - Index

**Guidelines are general rules every agent reads on every relevant action.** Where SOPs are skills (procedures the agent runs) and Workstreams are compositions (multi-agent choreography), Guidelines are the static rules and constraints that hold the whole system together. Naming, frontmatter, design system. SOPs and Workstreams `[[wikilink]]` to Guidelines rather than duplicating the rules.

Filename pattern: `GL-NNN-<title>.md`.

## Active Guidelines

| GL | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GL-001 | [[GL-001-file-naming-conventions]] | Kebab-case rules, ISO date prefix on date-driven files, slug rules, image filename pattern. |
| GL-002 | [[GL-002-frontmatter-conventions]] | YAML frontmatter field schemas for all 8 entity types, typing rules, foreign-key convention. Aligns with [[SOP-002-convert-mypka-to-sqlite]]. |
| GL-003 | [[GL-003-design-system]] | The visual identity SSOT. Six sections: identity, color palette, typography, spacing scale, imagery style, voice samples. Ships empty by design — populated via [[SOP-009-author-a-design-system]] (Iris's guided session). Read by Charta, Pixel, and any future creative agent on every task. |
| GL-005 | [[GL-005-adr-format]] | ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format, location, and lifecycle. ADRs live in per-document sibling folders (`<slug>-adr/`), numbered per document starting from ADR-001. Referenced by [[SOP-011-grill-with-docs]]. |

## When to write a new Guideline

- The rule is static and applies across many files or procedures.
- More than one SOP or Workstream needs to know about it.
- Without it, you would copy-paste the same rule into multiple files.

If you find yourself restating the same rule in two files, stop and write a Guideline. Then `[[wikilink]]` to it from both files.
